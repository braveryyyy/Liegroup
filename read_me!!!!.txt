Please run under the Matlab open source code PSINS of Associate Professor Yan Gongmin of Northwestern Polytechnical University, the open source code link is:http://www.psins.org.cn/kydm .The recommended version of the open
source code is psins230123.rar. Place the downloaded .m file for this project in the psins230123 folder and run it.
If you want to test the Lie group error model and traditional error model on moving base, please run: cpt_process.m (Measured data source URL: http://www.psins.org.cn/newsinfo/1590797.html)
If you want to test the combined error model on moving base, please run: cpt_com_process.m (Measured data source URL: http://www.psins.org.cn/newsinfo/1590797.html)
If you want to test the Lie group error model and traditional error model on static base, please run: fog_process.m (Measured data source URL: http://www.psins.org.cn/newsinfo/2678646.html)
I sincerely thank Associate Professor Yan Gongmin of Northwestern Polytechnical University for providing some of the source code and open source data.
